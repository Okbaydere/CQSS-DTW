function [pitch] = ptch_fix(pitch,CmdFile)

% PTCH_FIX
%   This is a MATLAB script to attempt some correction measures on the
%   calculated pitch track. The calculated pitch tracks must be present
%   already.

% INPUTS:
%   CmdFile: Command file (use default 'ptch_fix.dat', if not specified)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   pitch:  The pitch track after applying correction techniques
%
% NOTES:
%   The setup files needed to run this program are
%   ptch_fix.dat  - contains parameters needed for running the script.

%     This file is a part of the YAAPT program, designed for a fundamental 
%   frequency tracking algorithm that is extermely robust for both high quality 
%   and telephone speech.  
%     The YAAPT program was created by the Speech Communication Laboratory of
%   the state university of New York at Binghamton. The program is available 
%   at http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/zahorian as free software. Further 
%   information about the program could be found at "A spectral/temporal 
%   method for robust fundamental frequency tracking," J.Acosut.Soc.Am. 123(6),
