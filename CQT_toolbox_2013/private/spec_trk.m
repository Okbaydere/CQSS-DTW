%SPEC_TRK  Spectral pitch tracking for YAAPT pitch tracking
%
%   [SPitch, VUVSPitch, pAvg, pStd]=spec_trk(Data, Fs, VUVEnergy, Prm) 
%   computes estimates of pitch  using nonlinearly processed
%   speech (typically square or absolute value) and frequency domain processing
%   Search for frequencies which have energy at multiplies of that frequency
%
%INPUTS:
%   Data:      Nonlinearly processed signal, filtered with F1. (~50 to 1500Hz)
%   Fs:        The sampling frequency.
%   VUVEnergy: Voiced/ unvoiced decision, depending on nlfer
%   Prm:       Parameters
%
%OUTPUTS:
%   SPitch:    The spectral Pitch track, with the unvoiced regions filled using interpolation.
%   VUVSPitch: The spectral Pitch track, with  unvoiced regions set at zero
%   pAvg:      The average of the Pitch track value.
%   pStd:      The standard deviation in the track.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     This file is a part of the YAAPT program, designed for a fundamental 
%   frequency tracking algorithm that is extermely robust for both high quality 
%   and telephone speech.  
%     The YAAPT program was created by the Speech Communication Laboratory of
%   the state university of New York at Binghamton. The program is available 
%   at http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/zahorian as free software. Further 
%   information about the program could be found at "A spectral/temporal 
%   method for robust fundamental frequency tracking," J.Acosut.Soc.Am. 123(6), 
%   June 2008.
