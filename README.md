This GitHub repository contains the source code and resources for my graduation project at Karadeniz Technical University (KTU). The project focuses on Audio Copy-Move Forgery Detection (CMFD), an important task in digital audio forensics.

The dataset I have used can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i9TmYy_tZw6PUBrVN8oO7KVAJqe14r93/view.

Maybe I can add SVM in the future.
